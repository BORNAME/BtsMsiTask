{"name":"BtsMsiTask","tagline":"Simple msbuild task for generating MSI packages directly from a BizTalk solution without having to first install to BizTalk Server","body":"MSI files are great. MSI:s provides an easy way to package a set of files, add attributes, dependency information and even extra functionally to ease deployment. Traditionally the way to package BizTalk artifacts to an MSI has involved installing the artifacts to a BizTalk server and exporting them. With BtsMsiTask it however possible to package compiled artifacts directly into a MSI package without having to first installing them to a BizTalk Server.\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\nBtsMsiTask uses the exact same techniques as BizTalk Server does when exporting a MSI form the server. By reverse engineering we extracted the functionality and wrapped it in a stand alone library, not tied to the BizTalk Server infrastructure in any way. Any complied dll can now directly be packages into a BizTalk specific MSI without any further hassle.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
